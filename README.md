# Pipelined-8-bit-ALU-
Designed a Pipelined 8-bit ALU supporting arithmetic and logical operations including Addition, Subtraction, XOR and AND. Implemented pipeline stages to improve throughput and timing performance. Verified functional correctness and pipeline behavior through simulation. 

Below i have attached the output waveform for the specific test bench.
